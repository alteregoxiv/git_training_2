first we get the url for origin using : git remote get-url origin
now we use cmd : git remote add "name" "url"
now if we use git remote -v then we can see the remote repo has been added.

it is easy to synchronize between multiple git repos, esspecially pushing
to multiple remotes. it is helpful when people are maintaining copies or 
mirrors of the same repo.
