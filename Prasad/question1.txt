Cherry-pick is a command that helps to pick a commit from one branch and apply it to another.

Use-case : Useful for undoing any changes made to one branch that was meant for another and apply it to that branch

Steps:
Say, we have commits a , b , c , d
main branch commits are a and b
branch 2 has commits c and d

but commit d was originally meant for main branch
so first we switch to the main branch using "git switch main" or "git checkout main"
now we use the command "git cherry-pick d"
now commit d is switched to main branch
