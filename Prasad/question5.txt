git push --force : push --force can destroy other commits of other users in a repository.
    --force makes the head of the branch point to the users local history ignoring parallel
    changes.
    Say, a has pushed to the main repo. Then b tries to push to the master. This rebased branch will
    be rejected. Now if b uses push --force to push the work then a's work will be erased. b may think
    that its push was getting rejected because of the rebase and not a's push. So its better to use
    --force-with-lease

git push --force-with-lease : it will protect all remote refs that are going to be updated by requiring
    their current value to be the same as the remote tracking branch. it does not overwrite any work on 
    the remote branch if more commits were added to the remote branch. it ensures no one overwrites another
    ones work.
